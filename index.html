                <h1>Space planning and Interior architecture</h1>
                <p>Space planning is an area of interior design that we particularly enjoy. In home décor or architectural planning, whether its reconfiguring existing rooms, planning an entirely new layout or simply manoeuvring furniture to their best positions, we love the challenge.</p>
                <p>Our company's Interior Designers are qualified to space plan; architects have the technical and legal authority and final say. If the project is a new extension or new build, legality, mathematical calculations and specialist knowledge is required which involves architects and local building authorities.</p>

                <h1>Custom furniture and textile design</h1>
